Very old projects.
These are things I did in high school and prior
No guarantee of quality code, in fact I guarantee it is not of quality!
None of this is maintained. This exists purley for my own historical record.
Most of these projects are HTML5 web games, as that was what I had fun writing at the time.

Here is a short description of each project, keep in mind I am writing this at least 3 years after each was abandoned, so my memory may not serve me right
## beta
These are some smaller projects where I wanted to explore one feature, but not create something whole. 
### basik
This is a simple test to see if I could create animations using the HTML canvas
### dingon gen
An attempt to create a text dungeon generator. I never did anything for this one, so it is essentially nothing
### librie
My attempt to create a graphics library for the HTML canvas for some reason. I dont think I ever ended up using it
### Misc files
A lot of these are just loose files that have just about nothing in them. I will only create entries for notable ones. 
### island.html
A map of an "island" generator. Creates "biomes" of colored pixels that had semi-organic borders. THe slider at the top is meant to be analogous to temperautre. 
### tactoe.html
A console with tictactoe built in. Terrible AI, it just runs commands entered in JS, pretty simple, there are some other things in the code that I do not care to decypher.
## Encryptor
A really stupid encryption algorithm I created. Not secure, I do not remember how it works and I do not have the source code, just the jar file, so security by obscurity i guess
## Gamma
I got no clue on this one, sorry
## greed
A web based re-creation of the linux terminal game greed. I played the terminal version in class more than I should of. My high score was 72% (i have no proof of this)
## mine
The first version of 2d minecraft program I created. I tested my [Encryptor](#encryptor) program on it and scrambled the source code. It did not work to decrypt, so this project no longer really exists. Let this be its grave, and a reminder to backup your projects. 
## mine2
The second version of 2d minecraft. Kinda jank, but fairly cool. Code is nonsense, crafting is arcane. The same as my squnigus project.
## olden
Some really old projects of mine, back when I was in 7th grade and before. Keep in mind this code was written by a 12 year old. There are a couple of intersting things, but a lot of it is just pure nonsense. Proceed with caution.
## platform
An extremly jank platformer I created in 8th grade. Couldn't get a lot of things working, so I very much had the "it isnt a but, its a feature" mentality. Also comes with an arcane level designer. 
## Snake Cage
Old python projects, nothing special.
## Space2
The sequel to a videogame I made in 7th grade!! This time it is online using NodeJS and sockets. It also is mostly non-functional. The first one is lost to time.
## Star
A starmap generator. Kinda 3d looking, pretty cool
